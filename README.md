# Networking Simulations

Authors: Ittai Shay and Daniel Chen

This project consists of two parts. The first part is the simulation of a simple queueing system with a finite buffer
to study the packet loss probability as a function of the buffer size and the traffic intensity. The second part is the simulation of the Ethernet exponential backoff algorithm. We will implement both project in Python using SimPy.
